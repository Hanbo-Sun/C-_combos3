LICS.cpp: Longest Increasing Common Subsequence

exponent.cpp: given a sequence of nonnegative integers n1,n2,...,nk, computes and prints the last 4 digits of (· · · (n1)n2 )n3 · · ·)nk . If the last four digits are all zeros, print‘0’; otherwise, omit any leading zeros.

detectSquare.cpp: given coordinates of N points in the 2-D X-Y plane (read from cin), detects whether there are four points (among the N points provided), which form the four corners of a square with all edges parallel to the X or Y coordinate axes, and prints “Yes” or “No” correspondingly. The input contains 2N integers, with each pair of adjacent numbers representing the X and Y coordinates of a point.

minSubSum.cpp: given a sequence of integers (from cin), computes and prints the minimum sum of a contiguous subsequence. Empty subsequence (with a sum of 0) is also allowed.

sortIntervals.cpp: sortIntervals to sort a set of integer intervals in a non-decreasing order by their lower bounds. The intervals with the same lower bounds are sorted by their upper bounds. The sorting algorithm should be is stable. The input values will be 2n integers, denoted, l1, u1, l2, u2, . . . , ln, un. They represent the input intervals: [l1,u1],[l2,u2],...,[ln,un]

floatBinaryRep.cpp: float value represented as binary.
